# GYARTE-FamilyPlan
This repository consists of the code used for my Highschool project, "Family Plan".

It utilises Html and CSS for the front-end and uses PHP and MySql for the back-end. Sadly none of the Sql code has been saved to this repository so it is not opperational as it stands.

The concept of this website is to create a family calendar that works like this:
 - The family creates an account and each member creates their own profile. It has both a parent and a child type for profiles.
 - The 'children' of the account can put in things in their schedule and chose if they are to be chown in the parents schedule.
 - The parents can then see in their schedule what is happening during the week.

The intent of this website is to make it easier for families to plan out their weeks by supplying an overview of all practises, sleep-overs, parties etc. that their children might be up to.

The Sql code may be recreated at a later time, but seeing as this is an old and finished project it is unlikely.
