# GYARTE-FamilyPlan
This repository consists of the code used for my Highschool project, "Family Plan".

It utilises Html and CSS for the front-end and uses PHP and MySql for the back-end. Sadly none of the Sql code has been saved to this repository so it is not opperational as it stands.

The Sql code may be recreated at a later time, but seeing as this is an old and finished project it is unlikely.
